The job title. The steady income.
The smile I’ve learned to wear without effort.
“He’s doing well,” they say. And move on.</p><p>What they don’t see:
The rent I send away each month—clean, on time—
knowing it builds nothing that lasts.
The cost of distance from home,
measured in flights I delay and voices I miss.
The 2AM budgeting sessions,
trying to stretch one life across three timelines.</p><p>My wife is twenty-three.
Her friends post weekend escapes, careless adventures.
She doesn’t ask, but I see the pauses
the way her scrolling slows on someone else’s joy.
She traded in her youth for a quieter kind of life.
And I carry the guilt of that trade, quietly.</p><p>Every time I save for our daughter,
it’s a moment I can’t give her mother now.
Each “maybe next month”
is a little piece of living we don’t get back.</p><p>Meanwhile, my parents’ world is thinning.
A home that creaks. A car that coughs.
Savings that shrink in the shadow of rising costs.
They don’t complain, but I can feel the weight in their words.</p><p>If they spend now, what happens later?
If they don’t, what slips through the cracks today?
If I help, what do I take from my child?
If I don’t, what kind of son am I?</p><p>This is the math I do that no one sees.
The kind that doesn’t fit in spreadsheets.
The kind that makes you feel like you’re always behind
no matter how fast you move.</p><p>I make okay money, sure.
But there’s never enough to secure three generations at once.
My wife’s fleeting youth.
My daughter’s uncertain future.
My parents’ vulnerable present.</p>
